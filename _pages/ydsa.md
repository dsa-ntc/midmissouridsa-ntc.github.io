Mizzou Young Democratic Socialists of America is a student organization for socialists at the University of Missouri. We believe that the issues facing Mizzou students are rooted in capitalism, and its failures to provide for us. Massive student-loan debt, higher education being used as a barrier between classes, and the over-policing of campus all worsen the lives of Mizzou’s students. YDSA believes that students and student workers are the solution to these problems, not the administration we are taught to rely on. We hope to mass organize ourselves to build the leverage necessary to make our own lives better.

Our general meetings are currently held weekly on Wednesdays at 6 p.m. in LeFevre Hall, Room 106.

## Steering Committee

Mizzou YDSA’s executive decision-making body is our Steering Committee. This group is made up of our elected chairs: Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, and Social Media Chair.

Our current members are: Galen Zavala Sherby (Chair), Quinn Coffman (Co-Chair), Jonny Lewis (Treasurer), Mel Tully (Secretary), and Sami Binning (Social Media Chair).

## Coalition for Bodily Autonomy

A wave of reaction swept through the country in the early months of 2022. With the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, Missouri became the first state to outlaw safe abortions within its borders. This went hand in hand with continuing legislation at the state level to criminalize gender-affirming care and exclude trans youth from extracurricular sports. All of these attacks share a target: the right to bodily autonomy.

In accordance with a national YDSA resolution to combat anti-choice and transphobic legislation across the country, Mizzou YDSA committed itself to making MU administration take responsibility for the students this legislation endangered. We joined the **Coalition for Bodily Autonomy** alongside The Coalition for Graduate Workers, OASIS, Queer Liberation Front, Mizzou Queer and Trans POC, Sex Education At Mizzou, Stronger Together Against Relationship and Sexual Violence (STARS), Mid-Missouri DSA, and Mid-Missouri Peaceworks.

We issued three demands for the university.

1. That MU provides free contraceptives for all students who need them, specifically the Plan B pill.
2. That MU ends the censorship of the social justice centers so they can advise their students on how to protect themselves in our increasingly-hostile state.
3. That MU releases a statement condemning the Dobbs decision and its dangerous effects on their student body.

Over the 2022 Fall semester we held two large rallies to popularize these demands. Our first rally on Oct. 6 coincided with a national day of action for bodily autonomy hosted by YDSA national and the Graduate Student Action Network. We drew over 200 students and community members, including state representatives from Mid-Missouri.

In November we held a more somber vigil and rally, firstly to honor unknown victims of attacks on bodily autonomy, either from dangerous pregnancies and abortions or suicide. We laid three hundred candles at the steps of Jesse Hall and read the names of known victims. It was also a reminder to our administration that if they do not act, one of these candles could represent one of our classmates.

Mun Choi and his administration have refused to meet with us in a public setting. They want a closed-door meeting where they cannot be held responsible. Even as representatives of the world’s first journalism school, they have rejected having the press present at a meeting. Their actions show their loyalties: to our state’s reactionary government and not to their students.
