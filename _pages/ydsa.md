Mizzou Young Democratic Socialists of America is a student organization for socialists at the University of Missouri. We believe that the issues facing Mizzou students are rooted in capitalism, and its failures to provide for us. Massive student-loan debt, higher education being used as a barrier between classes, and the over-policing of campus all worsen the lives of Mizzou’s students. YDSA believes that students and student workers are the solution to these problems, not the administration we are taught to rely on. We hope to mass organize ourselves to build the leverage necessary to make our own lives better.

Our general meetings are currently held biweekly on Wednesdays at 6 p.m. in Switzler Hall, Room 101.

## Steering Committee

Mizzou YDSA’s executive decision-making body is our Steering Committee. This group is made up of our elected chairs: President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Social Media Chair, Committee Chair, Outreach Coordinator, and  Coalition Liaison.

Our current members are: Quinn C. (President), Adam M. (Vice President), Cameron B. (Treasurer), Ali H. (Secretary), Sadia M. (Social Media), Eileen W. (Committees), Emily S. (Outreach), and Anthony L. (Coalition).

## Committees

Mizzou YDSA has a series of committees we use to organize for specific goals. These committees have their own leadership and meeting times, they meet on the off-weeks when YDSA doesn’t have general meetings. Our current committees are:

- Political Education
- Environmental Action
- Student Labor: The YDSA Student Labor Committee is interested in building worker-representation and workplace democracy for Mizzou’s student workers, and student workers in Columbia in general.
- Mutual Aid Committee
