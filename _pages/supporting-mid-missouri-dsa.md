The Democratic Socialists of America depend on its members for financial support. This keeps the organization accountable to its members, as opposed to a separate class of donors.

The best way to support Mid-Missouri DSA is by [becoming a dues-paying member of the national organization](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership2020/). Any DSA members in the area who pay monthly dues support the chapter through DSA’s dues share program.

Some members chose to pay additional dues to their local chapter directly through a chapter dues program instituted by members at the chapter’s January 2022 convention. Chapter dues are currently dedicated to making sure the chapter will be able to send a delegate to the 2022 national convention regardless of their ability to pay. Suggested chapter dues are $5 a month. If you plan to pay chapter dues, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/rAh2V9DJ87bAQppe9).

Donations to the chapter’s community strike fund are dedicated to supporting striking workers in the region. The fund was created by a vote of chapter members at the January 2022 convention.

The chapter accepts chapter dues and donations through the [bank-to-bank payment platform Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/how-it-works), which is supported by most banks and credit unions. Send donation on Zelle to <{{ site.data.social.email.url }}>. Put “chapter dues” or “strike fund” in the memo line if you want your donation to go to those purposes.

Mid-Missouri DSA is a 501(c)4 social welfare non-profit. As such, donations are not tax-deductible.
