This form gathers a little contact information and gauges interest in Mid-Mo DSAâ€™s working groups and other chapter activities. To actually join DSA follow this link: [dsausa.org/join](https://www.dsausa.org/join) (consider joining as a monthly member, which triggers dues-sharing with local chapters). All dues-paying DSA members in mid-Missouri are automatically members of Mid-Mo DSA.

TODO: Add the form somehow
