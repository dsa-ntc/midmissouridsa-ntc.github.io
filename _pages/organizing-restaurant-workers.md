Restaurant workers deal with some of the worst pay and conditions in the United States economy. It doesn’t have to be this way: organized workers can secure a better deal for themselves and across the industry.

Mid-Missouri DSA is collecting information about working conditions at local restaurants. If you work for a local restaurant please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/pGibt61REVSweRrU7) — and if you don’t, please pass it along to anyone you know who does. If you are interested in working in support of this campaign or supporting our other labor organizing efforts [fill out our interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceaSAZPgjscl5VlVcOkwFuBIZk-f0fpxFMh2uUR_gOsFlhMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) or email <{{ site.data.social.email.url }}>.
