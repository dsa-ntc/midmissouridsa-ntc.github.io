Democratic socialists believe in the importance of a powerful, militant labor movement. A central way workers build and demonstrate their power is by withholding their labor. This strike solidarity fund provides an opportunity for Mid-Mo DSA and other community members to demonstrate their support for striking workers by laying aside resources in anticipation of strike action in the community.

Mid-Missouri DSA’s strike fund will be raised and spent according to a plan voted on by chapter members at the chapter’s January 2022 convention. Money can be spent on “food, drink, and other picket line support, costs associated with rallies and other publicity in support of strikers, and strike pay.”
