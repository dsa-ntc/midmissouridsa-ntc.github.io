COVID-19 relief funds should go directly to the people who need them the most. The Mid-Missouri chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America joins other community organizations in calling upon the Boone County Commission to use a portion of federal funding through the American Rescue Plan Act to send $500 to every Boone County household beneath 80 percent of the median income â€” a model [already being deployed in the City of St. Louis](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/news/500-cash-assistance-eligibility.cfm).

To secure this win for working people in Boone County, DSA members and our allies have gone door-to-door, collecting signatures in order to demonstrate to elected officials how strongly they feel about this issue. Previous canvassing campaigns have pushed for Columbia City Council to require decent wages and local hiring for city-subsidized construction projects and called on candidates to sign on to a [Neighborhood Pledge](https://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/054/033/original/Neighborhood_Pledge.pdf) in support of investments in city infrastructure, housing, and the fight against inequality.
