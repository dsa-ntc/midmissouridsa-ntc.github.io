YDSA chapters can be formed at any college, university, or high school. If you think there’s enough interest in your area follow [this link](https://y.dsausa.org/get-involved/start-a-chapter/) to begin the process of applying to have your chapter recognized. Local DSA and YDSA members would be happy to talk you through the process and the local work you could get involved with — just email <{{ site.data.social.email.url }}>.
