Current campaigns by Mid-Missouri DSA include our efforts to [organize restaurant workers](../organizing-restaurant-workers/), going door-to-door in support of [sending COVID-19 relief directly to working people](../american-rescue-plan/), and our [Peopleâ€™s Book Club](../peoples-book-club/).

Our priorities are set by our members and pursued through their work as volunteers. As our membership grows, we will be able to add new campaigns and add new force to our existing efforts. [Join today](../get-involved/).
