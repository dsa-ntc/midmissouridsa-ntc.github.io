## At Mizzou

You can join Mizzou YDSA through [this link](https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/mizzouydsa) as well as find our Mizzou Engage page.

Mizzou YDSA members aren’t required to pay dues, however the more dues-paying members we get the more representation we get at YDSA’s national conventions. Funds from dues are split between our own chapter and YDSA national, and are necessary to keep our organization free from a patron’s outside influence.

YDSA student dues are only $20/year, and a dues waiver can be filled out for members who want to be involved but can’t provide dues funds. More information on dues and how to sign up for them can be found [here](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/ydsa_membership_2021/). Make sure to mark Mizzou YDSA as your chapter for us to receive your dues.

## Away from Mizzou

You do not need a chapter at your school to [join YDSA](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/ydsa_membership_2021/) and [start organizing your peers](http://midmodsa.org/starting-a-ydsa-chapter/).
