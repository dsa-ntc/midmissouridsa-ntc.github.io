# README for Chapters

This document intends to give instructions on how to do anything you want to do with your site. All these instructions assume you have the Github repository open in a browser tab: [your chapter's repository](https://github.com/dsa-ntc/midmissouridsa-ntc.github.io).

If instructions are missing for something you want to do, please reach out to the NTC for help.

## Adding a New Post

Go to the `_posts` directory.

Click the "Add file" dropdown and then click the "Create new file" option.

![Create new file option](/readme-assets/chapter_readme/posts-click.png)

Add the front matter at the top of the file and the post content at the bottom. Jekyll has a documentation page on both [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). You can also look at your previous posts for what should be included in the front matter and how to include links and pictures.

![Post front matter and content](/readme-assets/chapter_readme/post-sections.png)

Name your post following the convention of your other posts: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-name-of-your-post.md` and click the "Commit changes..." button.

On the "Commit changes" screen, you can change the "Commit message" and "Extended description" if you'd like (or leave it as is). Hit the "Commit changes" button at the bottom, and the post will be published to your site in the next 10 minutes.

## Editing Landing Page Content

The file `_data/copy.yml` contains some of the text that shows up on your landing page, and some that shows up on every page. The `welcome` and `landing-page-text` show up on the landing page. The `about` is displayed in the footer of every page. Below are screenshots of the file itself and where the text appears on the landing page.

Edit this page as explained in the [Editing an Existing Page](#editing-an-existing-page) section. Your changes should be reflected on your site within 10 minutes.

## Editing the Navigation Header

The file `_data/nav.yml` determines which links appear in the header of every page.
