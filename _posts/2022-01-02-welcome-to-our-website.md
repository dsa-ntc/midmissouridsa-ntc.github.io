This website will feature information about the Mid-Missouri chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America and its activities. The chapter owes a debt to the work of member Chris G. and [Seattle DSA](https://github.com/SeattleDSA/dsa_wordpresshttps://github.com/SeattleDSA/dsa_wordpress), whose template for chapter websites we adapted for our own use here.

Our front page banner is taken from the mural “America Today” by Thomas Hart Benton, a Missourian and New Dealer whose “Social History of Missouri” represents a rare (and sadly figurative) representation of ordinary Missourians in the state capitol in Jefferson City. “America Today” was commissioned before but completed after the onset of the Great Depression, which inspired Benton to add this last panel, representing the desperate inequality and human need that followed the economic and technological progress depicted elsewhere in the mural.
